This repository is the code for course project of AI 502 2023 at KAIST. 

The goal is to train noise-robust feature extractor and also enable the feature extractor to distinguish between different sensor data sequences (to increase feature variations to avoid overfitting) and also increase label size on K-EmoPhone D#1.
