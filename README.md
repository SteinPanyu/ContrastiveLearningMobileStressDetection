# ContrastiveLearningMobileStressDetection
This repository is the code for course project of AI 502 2023 at KAIST. 

The goal is to train noise-robust feature extractor and also enable the feature extractor to distinguish between different sensor data sequences (to increase feature variations to avoid overfitting) using contrastive learning and also increase label size on K-EmoPhone D#1. The feature extractor is pretrained on unlabeled sensor data sequences.
